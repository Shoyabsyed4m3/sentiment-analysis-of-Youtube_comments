I currently have a little time on my hands and have always been interested in programming, so I'm trying to learn Javascript/html/css to do some freelance work or maybe even FT if the conditions are right.  The languages itself seems pretty easy, and I have no issues understanding the concepts/logic, as I'm progressing through the structured lessons.  However, on step ""3) Start a project"", I'm kind of clueless where to start.  Any advice or suggestions for resources that I can use to overcome this?  Ideally something that walks you step by step on a simple real world project, using the peripheral tools that are sometimes a bigger challenge than learning the language itself.  Thanks in advance, Anthony"

Hey Yk m weak in Java and JS Python.. how can improve to good extent and what resources shud i go thro...
"Good advice about learning Python, JavaScript, and taking courses from Udemy. Python and JavaScript are very popular and deceptively simple. Once you learn them, you can dig into them as deeply and you want to go. Udemy often puts its courses on sale for as low as $10. Wait for a sale and sign up for several classes. The nice part about Udemy courses is once you sign up for them, you can go back and review the material any time you want, and if the course gets updated, the updates are included at no extra change.

You talk about ""learning to code"". This is a sore spot for me, having worked in IT for 50 years (now retired, but still coding in Python). It's not enough just to know HOW to code. You have to know something about WHAT to code; how to organize and maintain your code; and how to solve real-world problems using your code. You had two advantages in this area: (1) You knew statistics, and (2) You wrote code to solve your personal needs and interests.

Over my 50 years programming, most of my jobs were pretty boring. Not everybody gets to work on the coolest project. The only thing that kept my interest was the ability to learn and write code on my own, and then leverage that knowledge to get a better job. When all I knew was COBOL, FORTRAN, and BASIC, I learned C and got a better job. When all I knew was MS-DOS, I learned Windows and Microsoft Access and got a job programming in Windows. Then I learned about the Internet and got a job working for Microsoft. Then, from there to working in dot-com's, then learning Java and building smart-phone apps.

If you want to make money writing code, you have to know something else besides just writing code, and you have to commit to a lifetime of growth and learning. You also have to be willing to innovate and take risks and network with people."

"I like your video, bro. nice work!"
"I see a lot of people are still asking questions like ""how to find a personal project to work on?"". Well I feel them , because the languages that I know are C and C++ , so it seems to me that I cannot do anything fancy (I do not know how ti build a webpage for example), only if I want to devote time to learn Qt5 (it is based on C++ ) could I build some application with a graphical user-interface.  So I am still reading books about Algorithms , and about general C++ (I have not even studied Stroustrup's book yet, the 2013 edition, I am reading other books on C and C++) . The most jobs on C/C++ seem to be on embedded development, so learning Arduino seems a nice option. Also all you people that know some language that does not feel proper for starting a personal project, do this : find an open-source application that is build on this language , and start learning its codebase, start contributing to its documentation, and eventually fixing bugs . So you will be able to say in an interview :""I have been a contributor to this open-source project that is build in Python/C/java ..., I fixed N number of bugs"".  I have not started that myself, but it seems the only option to get the attention of the companies."

""Dear BLAH BLAH, 

We were amazed at your skills, thanks for submitting the task, although you did well, we regret to inform we have hired another who was more of a close match to the requirements. we are sorry that we have decided to not move with your application as we have found someone better at current requirements. "" 

I'm not a newbie, 5 years experienced professional, still learning and improving every day, have a long list of endorsement and public project to showcase, BUT, there is always someone ""close match"". 

so, no matter how hard you learn or try, dear friends companies like Google won't hire you because they have a stack of resumes and they have a preference based on personal refers, they only post a job for positive impression, in fact, they don't even need to post jobs, people who are hired are 1% because of luck, maybe google wanted to try to rebel and ignore refers. and 99% referral system."

The only hard thing about programming is understanding the basics trust me when you finish the basics like how do functions work and a bit more of complex algorithms you would be able to build whatever you want limited only to your imagination and time and whenever you get stuck go look up Stack overflow they probably have your answer there already if not you could ask and some more skilled programmers will help you in no time

Coming to your 4 suggestions that you had offered, I feel that the 4th one about getting an internship would be too impractical firstly because of my regular job schedule and also the fact that hardly a few organizations would take me up as an intern at 49 years, nearing 50. So i please advise you to fix this one for me. The rest of the suggestions are very much commendable."

"Hi CS Dojo,
Can you help me with how to get/apply internships?
What should be done to stand out from the crowd so as to get a call for internship interview?"
"I mean... it's not always *that* easy. A person I know that is working for Google right now found it difficult to get into the company; they are very smart and went to a top 5 university in the UK. My own boyfriend, that organises algorithmics training sessions within a society (so he knows his stuff), wasn't able to get in. It really depends on how lucky you are, not just how hard you work."
"I think technical interview skill is the highlight:
reasons?
1) I have more computer skill and technical skill than average people. (Software engineering, design thinking, algorithm design & analysis, reverse engineering, website development, database & big data design, networking & communication...etc)
2) I can code (professional level) in many language (Java, C++, XML, Javascript JQuery, SQL, Python...etc) yet I figured none of this is useful if the foundation (problem solving, program design paradigm, basic knowledge on how computer hardware & system work) is absent.
3) If you know something but you are unable to express it, then you are determined to fail.
Last but not least, build your own startup instead of clinging to a satisfying salary. When you get used to a stable life, you will lose your courage to start all over again. Especially to those who are in debt for car and house loan."

you know you should learn us python programming language. thanx for your great videos.
thaks for this video. this video give me motivation to learn about coding .give me more video like this :v
"None of those website will teach you C++.
Why did i listen to this guy ?"
"As a statistics grad, you learned programming, and then got a job as Software Engineer? Very interesting because a CS undergrad student takes many more classes in the related field such as upper division computer science in software development if that's the discipline in CS."

Sir from india how to start if i know nothing about programming before but want to learn it very badly
Thankyou very much!it's very helpful.

I've been wanting to learn how to code for a while now but i just couldn't get started because of an extremely unfortunate and traumatizing incident with a teacher who humiliated me. I was intimidated and discouraged. thanks for your videos it really helps. i'm starting today to learn the basics of programming.
How can someone even be not a native speaker and speak so damn well and express themselves so greatly. you are amazing
Ty for the info. Not judging but you look like your living very modestly for an employee at google as an engineer. It doesnt inspire desire to be in this field.
what programming language did use to get a job as a software developer
How many likes for Project Oiler?
Why don't you start making videos on teaching how to code for beginners and really make us get through the first line where we will always stuck since you were also a beginner like us once you will be knowing how to teach to someone like you...just a kind suggestion loved your video was really helpful

There so many many ways to make a living.. just don't be lazy and go for it.. wow I can remember back in the day no YouTube and all the hours, days weeks and months learning this and feeling lost. One day it all click like glue and I was off to the races.  I find your story really inspiring.  I AM A FAN FOR LIFE."

Hello CS Dojo! I really like your videos. I‚Äôm a student of ICS (Intermediate) in PK. And I want to become e software and computer hardware engineer. I want to learn languages of computer. Can u tell me that which language is best for me?
How much time did it take to become a programer
"Aah I am sick of videos of this kind, on this channel I have not find a single video which is useful. Most of the stuff on which he is making tutorials is so basic and easy that you don't even need to watch a video for it and if you want to watch basic stuff then there are way too many channels on YouTube who are already doing that and way way better than cs dojo. 

Unsubscribed buddy."
My head hurts
u r great
dude you're awesome :)
Really Awesome
"Your videos are extreamly helpful, and have been inspiring me to keep coding and learning more - so thank you!!  I have a question, though - you said you took two courses to start and they both used Java. I keep reminding myself of the Elon Musk quote about how learning is like a tree, and I'd really like to get my foundation down on the key ideas before diving more into the languages themselves (already using FreecodeCamp and Codecademy), and was wondering if the classes you took are accessible online?  I saw a  clip in the video to MIT's 6.006 2011 course, but the course details say they used Python.  Is this one of the courses that you took?

Again, you're videos are incredibly helpful, and are much appreciated!:)"

"3:20 I'm not working in a tech company, but I'd suggest learning a language like C# or Java, as learning about primitive types, as well as about classes, is very important.
After mastering C#/Java, I'd suggest learning JavaScript/Python, as you said - as these languages are very popular. JavaScript may even be more popular, as it's used both in client-side, server-side (Node.js) and in desktop applications (Electron, which is also based on Node.js) - and it's eventually a cross-platform language, for both desktop - Windows, macOS, Linux - both in the form of Electron and in the web, and it's cross-platform in the mobile devices - Cordova, as well as the web."

Only to find out that google did the same thing 1 year after me and no one cared much about it. What if all you did was switch from your Major to a slightly different carrier and this entire video is pointless because what you really need to to do something is just doing it, but you also need a Degree about something that is connected to is.

How to think like a programmer?
Extremely helpful thanks.
"As much as I respect you, I have to disagree with your statement that says you should learn asking for help. That asking for help is more often than not the worst choice sometimes when learning programming. Programming is all about that motivation to correct all those small mistakes and make that damn code run properly, even if the problems are difficult to solve. If you try to fix the problematic code by yourself, it may take you longer to progress in learning, but after spending half an hour and then finally finding the solution, you are gonna train your brain,  catch some extra knowledge while you're at it, and the solution you've been searching for for so long is guaranteed to teach you not to repeat the same mistake again."

"I love Javascript but I don't think a beginner should start with JS at all. The language is way too flexible and the student is gonna have a really rough time learning another not-so-flexible language. Python is perfect as a first language. When you're pretty confident at that, go to JS. Never the other way around."
"Hey sir , can you please make a video on "" Programming basics""? I am finding a perfect video but haven't found one yet. I want to learn all stuffs regarding programming languages like terminology , variables , if else statement , etc. 

Please sir.
Thanks

Dojo can you link the websites and programs you used with their desc.  Please cause I cant keep up
"I started with HTML (I had no idea what i was doing and read that 'the internet was build out of html' üòÇ)
Over that i went on with Java Script. At some point i got bored and quit... a month later i discovered Python and I have to say Python was a hundred times better for beginners than Java Script. I would DEFINITLY recommend Python to start with!"
Plz suggest some software for websites & applications development.....
Thanks sir for your helpful advice :) It is very beneficial :)
Thank you üôÇ
"Hi dojo,
We are very interested to watch more programmic problems. We wanted to know about the optimal solutions you used to solve it. Bring us more difficult and tough programs asked in Google / Microsoft for us to prepare. So that it will be more useful

"CS Dojo, since you're a former Google developer, I hope you weren't one of those developers who created constraintLayout because it's a buggy mess.

Why doesn't the softInputMode work with constraintLayout when I try to constrain a button/mapView, label, you name it, to the bottom of the view?

When I click on editText, searchView or anything else that makes keyboard pop up, the entire layout jumps up and every button, label and even mapView jumps up too. Why does this bug happen in constraintLayout? I can't seem to find a fix other than to recreate my XML file with relativeLayout instead of constraint.

I can't seem to find a solution to this constraintLayout softInputMode issue. Is there one? I can't find a fix on stackOverflow either."
How much time the whole steps took
Can you make a video about  game coding
"I hope i can be like you bro. Im 4th year student of software engineering, and the languages that i really understand only html,php,css,JavaScript.

Hey cs dojo i love ur vids .. i wanna ask if i can learn js without learning html/css ! Or i should learn all!
wat this man dont mention is that the first step gonna take u a year
Hey man. I barely subscribe to channels but you're just super awesome. Thankyou so much for all the efforts and being fabulous
"How to learn how to code

1- Get off your lazy ass

2- stop watching more than 10 minutes on youtube

3- pick a easy language to start out with
(python, JavaScript, etc. If the impact seems too heavy start with learning basic coding concepts with Scratch)

4- Read the documentation for the language of choice

 (Youtube tutorials are bad ,since docs explain what every character does practically, causing little confusion)

4.5- learn how to fix your own syntax errors ,so you can develop problem solving skills. Don't jump straight towards asking a question if you don't even try to figure out the problem on your own 

(You can't use stack overflow forever)

5- move to c++ to C

5.5- learn data structures and algorithms

6- learn memory manipulation to hack video games and wreck noobs if you are especially feeling like an asshole that day

7- follow the daily programmer on reddit and beat as many hard, normal, and easy challenges as possible

8- Think outside the box and practice constantly


9- Repeat and learn more about the already selected languages you chose.



//You are always learning, try to catch them all
//Only learn what you need when just starting out."
"what do you think about the new language 
kotlin 
????

"I would recommend to learn Python first. The language is a great choice because: a) It offers clear, readable syntax; b) You will quickly progress; c) There are a lot of widely available resources; d) It has a very supportive community; e) Python has a lot of applications in various domains (e.g., machine learning, web development, data science)."
